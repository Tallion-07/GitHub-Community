## About

---

A (currently) Private Repo which contains the Projects Listed below.
I am using this Repository to learn about various things regarding Project Management, Documentation, Planning, Programming, Testing and Implementation and I am currently working on the following areas:

* Properly setting up my personal repository.
* Managing Multiple projects and staying organised.
* Planning projects that what I am working on.
* Learning the various Tools that are Freely available (FOSS) where Possible.
* Full and proper documentation of what I am doing and what I have done.
* Visual Studio Code:
  * Properly Learning about how to use:
    * Extensions
    * Software settings
    * Functionality
    * Testing
    * Environments
  
Eventually some of the Things I learn and document will end up on this Repository as information for the General Public, with all personal security information (naturally) removed.

Overtime this will hopefully be transformed into something that will be useful to others, but like many I will also have to earn a living and progress will be slow in forthcoming.

Best Regards,
Tallion o7
