# About

All of My Repositories listed on the [Readme](/README.md#contents) show all of the Projects I am currently working on (when time permits) .

I am also using these Repositories to learn about various things regarding Project Management, Documentation, Planning, Programming, Testing and Implementation, so I am currently focusing on the following areas:

* Properly setting up my personal repository.
* Managing Multiple projects and staying organised.
* Planning projects that what I am working on.
* Learning the various Tools that are Freely available (FOSS) where Possible.
* Full and proper documentation of what I am doing and what I have done. 
  
  Visual Studio Code:
  Properly Learning about how to use:
   * Extensions
   * Software settings
   * Functionality
   * Testing
   * Environments
    
  
Eventually some of the Things I learn and document will end up on this Repository as information for the General Public, with all personal security information (naturally) removed.

Overtime this will hopefully be transformed into something that will be useful to others, but like many I will also have to earn a living and progress will be slow in forthcoming.

Best Regards,
