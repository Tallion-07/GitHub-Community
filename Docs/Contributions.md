## Using Labels

Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.

* The [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/Tallion-07/Tallion-o7-Public-Documentation/labels/help%20wanted) is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
* The [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/Tallion-07/Tallion-o7-Public-Documentation/labels/good%20first%20issue) is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
* The [`documentation` label](https://github.com/Tallion-07/Tallion-o7-Public-Documentation/labels/documentation) is for problems or updates in the content on docs.github.com. These will usually require some knowledge of Markdown.
* The [`engineering` label](https://github.com/Tallion-07/Tallion-o7-Public-Documentation/labels/Engineering) is for problems or updates in the github.com/Tallion-07 website. These will usually require some knowledge of JavaScript/Node.js or YAML to fix.
